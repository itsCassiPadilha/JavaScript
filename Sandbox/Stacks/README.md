------

- **StackCB.js:** implementation of a stack data type using JS' "class" syntax, including some true Private Fields<sup>[[1]](#aboutPrivateFields)</sup>;
- **StackPB.js:** same as above, but using JS' "prototype" syntax. How it is not possible to implement true Private Fields<sup>[[1]](#aboutPrivateFields)</sup> using this syntax ruling, Private Fields are named in *camelCase* and are not documented, whereas Public Fields are named in *PascalCase* and are documented.
